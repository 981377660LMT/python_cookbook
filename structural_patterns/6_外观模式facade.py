The Facade pattern is a way to provide a simpler unified interface to
a more complex system. 
For example, we can turn on a computer by just pressing a button, but in
fact there are many procedures and operations done when that happens
(e.g., loading programs from disk to memory).
例如Node封装的API
This pattern can be seen in the Python standard library when we use
the isdir function. Although a user simply uses this function to know
whether a path refers to a directory, the system makes a few
operations and calls other modules (e.g., os.stat) to give the result.
